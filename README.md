### Discussion of this project
I have developed an educational web application. In this application, I have added some programming languages for learning, like programming language exercises, tutorials, and some premium courses.
On the home page, some data will be preloaded, like exercises on the left side and many tutorials. Each tutorial shows a cart with well-known details. Learners will learn smartly.
In the exercise section, I have done it as `Premium`. Whoever does not have an account on this site cannot access these `premium exercises`.
The header section contains `courses`, `blogs`, and `FAQ`, as well as `login`, `log out`, `register`, and `profile icons`, and one toggle button for `dark and light` mode.
In the Login and Register form, there is a toggle button and a forgot `password` system, and you can sign in with the Google and GitHub systems.
In the `profile` section, there are two features: one is `update profile`, and the second is `update password`.
In the courses section, each course has two clickable buttons:` description` and purchase. Without a login, learners can see course descriptions but have no access. They must have an account as a login; otherwise, they cannot access them. because this is a private route. Anyone can print the course description` as a PDF.
